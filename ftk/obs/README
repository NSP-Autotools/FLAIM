OpenSuSE Build System (OBS)
---------------------------

The OpenSuSE Build System is available at http://build.opensuse.org. This
really cool project allows individual contributors to become the package
maintainer for their own package repositories. It also provides a nice 
compile farm, with the ability to produce packages for rpm and debian 
based systems, including OpenSuSE, SuSE Linux Enterprise (SLE), RedHat
Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS and more.

The files in this directory are used only in the process of building various
binary packages on the OpenSuSE Build System. The only exception to this 
statement is the rpm spec file, which is also used to build rpm files from 
the command line using "make rpms".
